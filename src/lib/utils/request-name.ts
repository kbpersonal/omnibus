// src/lib/utils/request-name.ts
//
// The search term a request is filed under. ONE implementation, because two doors now file
// requests — the series page and the library-wide Missing Issues view — and the downloader's
// search (with its annual guard and its numeric-aware matching, #202/#203) keys on this exact
// string. Two copies would drift, and a drift here is a request that quietly hunts for the wrong
// thing from one door and the right thing from the other.
//
// Rules, in the order they shipped:
//   - Issue #200: parsedNum is NaN→null for anything parseFloat can't read, so the raw stored
//     number is the fallback — a request never says "#null".
//   - #203 Phase 0: an annual carries its domain in the composite ("Series Annual #N"), which is
//     what flips the downloader's annual-aware guards for that request.
//   - #203 COLLECTED: a trade is searched for by its OWN title ("X-Men: From the Ashes Vol. 1"),
//     never as "{Series} #1" — that would hunt for a single issue that isn't the book.
