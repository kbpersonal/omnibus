// src/lib/session-expiry-client.ts
//
// #204 (de6oliveira-droid): the Smart Matcher, left open for a day or two, greeted the next click
// with a black dialog reading "Unauthorized Access". Two different expiries exist and the client
// handled only one: the admin INACTIVITY window flags the token {error:"SessionExpired"} and the
// header signed the user out on it — but the session COOKIE itself lives six hours, and once it is
// gone the periodic refetch returns an EMPTY session with no flag. Nothing redirected, the page
// stayed up, and the next /api call came back as the middleware's 401, rendered as dialog text.
//
// These are the pure pieces of the fix (the guard in AuthProvider.tsx wires them up):
//   - a session that turns empty AFTER the user was signed in is treated exactly like the flag;
//   - any 401 from our own /api (not NextAuth's) while a user was signed in is the same event;
//   - the user lands on /login with a return path, so "pick up where you left off" is one click.
// Pure and test-facing; `nav` is the one side effect, seamed so tests can watch it.
